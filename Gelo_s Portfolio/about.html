                <h2>Hello, I'm Gelo!</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate computer science student with a keen interest in software development, coding, and technology. My journey into the world of tech has been exciting and challenging, and I enjoy learning new things every day.</p>
                <p>With my skills in programming languages and tools, I love creating websites and working on projects that my instructor gives to me. In addition to coding, I am interested in editing using photoshop and premiere pro, playing online games, and exploring new places.</p>
